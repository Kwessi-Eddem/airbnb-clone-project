# AirBnB Clone Project
## Overview
This is a complete, real-world application designed to simulate the developent of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep understanding of full stack development with the aim of understanding complex architectures, workflows and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.
The clone AirBnB project as a learning requirement for the ALX ProDev back-end program.

## Project Goals
- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registeration, authentication and profile management.
- Property management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
- Project manager: Responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.
- UI/UX designer: UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product.
- Software architect: Expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team.

## Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
The application relies on a relational database to manage users, property listings, booking, reviews and payments.

### Entities and Fields
- Users - id, name, email, password_hash, role
- Properties - id, title, description, location, price_per_night, owner_id
- Booking - id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status
- Review - id, user_id,property_id, rating, comment
- Payments - id, booking_id, amount, payment, method, status

### ER Relationships
- A **User** can act as both a **guest** (who makes bookings) and a **host** (who lists properties).  
- A **Property** belongs to one **User** (the host) but can have many **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** (the guest) and one **Property**.  
- A **Review** belongs to one **User** (the reviewer) and one **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is tied to a single **Booking**.

## Feature Breakdown
1. **User Management**
 This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It ensures proper authentication and role distinction between hosts (who list properties) and guests (who make bookings), forming the foundation of the application.

2. **Property Management**
 Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details such as location, price, and availability. This feature makes it possible for guests to browse accurate, up-to-date information when choosing accommodations.

3. **Booking System**
 The booking system enables guests to reserve properties by selecting available dates and submitting requests. It handles conflicts, tracks booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled), and ensures a smooth reservation process.

4. **Payment Processing**
 This feature manages secure transactions by allowing guests to pay for bookings through supported methods (e.g., card, mobile money). It helps maintain trust in the platform by recording amounts, statuses, and ensuring hosts receive their earnings.

5. **Review System**
 Guests can leave ratings and comments on properties after their stay, providing feedback to hosts and guidance to future guests. This feature builds credibility, transparency, and community trust within the platform.

6. **Data Optimization**
 Efficient queries, indexing, and caching are implemented to ensure smooth performance even as the number of users, bookings, and listings grows. This feature supports scalability and improves the overall user experience by reducing delays.


## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is essential to protect sensitive data, maintain trust, and ensure safe transactions within the platform. The following security measures will be implemented:

### Key Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
Only verified users can access protected routes using secure login (e.g., JWT tokens).
Ensures that requests are tied to real users and prevents unauthorized access.

2. **Authorization**
Role-based access control to differentiate between hosts, guests, and admins.
Prevents users from performing actions outside their permissions (e.g., a guest editing another host’s property).

3. **Rate Limiting**
Restricts the number of requests from a client within a given time frame.
Protects against brute-force attacks and prevents misuse of the API.

4. **Data Encryption**
Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, payment details) is encrypted both at rest and in transit (HTTPS).
Protects user credentials and financial data from interception or leaks.

5. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
All inputs are validated to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection-based attacks.
Ensures data integrity and prevents malicious requests from compromising the system.


## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) are practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. CI ensures that new changes are continuously tested and integrated into the codebase, while CD automates deployment so that new features and fixes reach users faster.

### Why it’s Important

- Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment, reducing manual errors.
- Reliability: Ensures code is tested before merging, preventing bugs from reaching production.
- Scalability: Makes it easier to maintain and grow the project as more features are added.
- Collaboration: Helps teams work smoothly by catching integration issues early.

### Possible Tools

- GitHub Actions – Automates workflows for testing, building, and deploying the application.
- Docker – Standardizes the application environment, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.
- GitHub Actions – Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows for the Django/DRF application.
- Celery + Redis – Supports background task execution in the pipeline, such as sending notifications or processing jobs.
- PostgreSQL (with migrations) – Integrated into the pipeline to manage schema updates automatically.
